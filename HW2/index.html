    <h3>A SONG BY MEN I TRUST</h3>

<p class="lyricsA"> Motion blurred dream visions and kindred faces <br>
Thoughts like bursts of youth taking me places <br>
Living the best outcome of myself <br>
'Cause I do remember where I come from </p>
<p class="lyricsB"> I'm happy my home found me <br>
By which force I do not know <br>
I found my home and it grows by me in beauty </p>
<p class="lyricsC"> I feel air from another planet akin <br>
Like a sense of truth that comes from within <br>
A budding sapling reaching through <br>
Giving rise to higher fruit and view </p>
<p class="lyricsD"> I'm happy my home found me <br>
By which force I do not know <br>
I found my home and it grows by me in beauty </p>
<p class="lyricsE"> I'm happy my home found me <br>
By which force I do not know <br>
I found my home and it grows by me in beauty <br>
